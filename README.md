## Introduction ##
SimplyLogs is our attempt at creating a more user-friendly and powerful inventory tracking application. Our prototype aims to improve the experience and accessibility of inventory/asset tracking by automating key processes like serialising, invoice generation and accounting, introducing a cleaner, more aesthetically pleasing user interface, and allowing for some level of customisation.
